# My Setup

## Distribution

As of now, I'm currently using Nobara Linux. This is a derivative of Fedora Linux. There are multiple reason my I'm using this distro as main OS.

1. If you game on Linux, which I do, this distro come with many patches and pre-configured software and settings which reduce manual task.
2. Many built in kernel patches with of my laptop, So I don't have to patch the kernel manually every time.

These are mainly the two biggest reasons. If you want to know more, visit their [website](https://nobaraproject.org/).

## Desktop Environment&#x20;

GNOME is the DE is use. Although it wasn't my first choice, but over the years I have somewhat grown fond of it. Recent changes and updates for GNOME are giving it a more refined look. Also, GUI support is awesome. Although I do want to shift to a window manager as it gives you more freedom to change the UI, but I choose not too as I don't have time to invest in it yet.

## Gaming On Linux

Yes, you  can play games on Linux, thanks to wine, proton, lutris and many more software packages which make it easy to start gaming on Linux. Most of the time all games run without any issue, but sometimes you need to do a little tweaking and they work flawlessly. Since Nobara Linux also made of gaming purposes, it's very easy to get started.&#x20;
