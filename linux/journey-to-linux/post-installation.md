# Post Installation

Later on I'll add more things or you can contribute to this.

## Things to do after Installation:

* [ ] Install Graphics Drivers if they aren't installed automatically.
* [ ] Install your favorite Web Browser. Firefox is best but anyways it's your choice.
* [ ] Get yourself familiar with package-managers and CLI. You can watch YT Videos for this.
* [ ] Personalize your desktop according to your need. Here are some [YT Videos regarding this.](https://www.youtube.com/@linuxscoop)
