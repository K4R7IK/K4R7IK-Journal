# Journey to Linux

> #### Linux is only free if your time has no value.

Embark on a transformative Linux journey, gaining a unique understanding of operating systems. Unlock the power to stand out from the crowd. Given that you are able to invest in proper time. Weeks will fly by without you even noticing it.

Here's want you need to know before really getting into Linux :scroll:

* You should know how to google errors. There will be a time you will encounter some error while interacting with the **CLI** or **GUI**. In the case of **GUI** it's rare but with **CLI** it's pretty common.
* Since Linux and Windows are completely different you should drop your old window habit and start picking up new one.
* **Patience** is must. Sometime a silly mistake take hours to solves. Happened to me when I started with Linux.
* Communities are your best friend. Like **Reddit**, **Discord**, **AskUbuntu** etc. Most of newbies questions can be found here.
* Before start using a random project of GitHub, make sure to read it's **ReadMe.**
* If you are someone who giveup after things don't workout are you want, then don't switch.
