# ðŸ¤“ About Me

## Who am I ?

A Final Year Bachelor student who can't fixate on one thing. All the way from India :flag\_in:. Also known as the Engineers' Hub :globe\_with\_meridians:. I whole heartily study Computer Science and half heartily go to attend my lectures cuz I'm sleepy :zzz:.

## Myself ++

Since you're here why not I share somethings that I like :heart:.

* 3+ Year spend in the Linux Rabbit Hole. Learned some essential stuffs.
* Highly interested in CyberSec. Although I love it but I don't see it as my career for now. Idk why.
* Developed many things, not for the masses but to fulfill my daily need. This webpage is also one of them. :grimacing:.

{% hint style="info" %}
**About:** As I'm learning day by day, I'm trying to keep this page updated. Although sometime it's boring to track each and every progress.
